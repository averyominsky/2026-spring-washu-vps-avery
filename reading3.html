I found the Cyborgs vs. Rooms article interesting because I enjoy using wearables like my Apple Watch and AirPods, as I have noticed they significantly enhance my everyday life. I would notice their absence if I didn’t have them. The idea of exploring room-scale computing is intriguing because I don’t usually think about these objects as much. I’ve always found Google Homes and Alexas somewhat unnecessary, since the same tasks can often be done just as easily with a phone. Some of the more extreme concepts, like body modifications or even magnets in fingertips for an electric field are cool to imagine. Overall, I don’t doubt that the world will develop these technologies, but I hope their adoption doesn’t negatively affect our sense of community and self.
