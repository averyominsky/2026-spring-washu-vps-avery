The article “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?” is motivating to create. The statement that students still ask how to “actually” make a website surprised me. However, the underlying question of how to create a meaningful website, makes more sense. I agree with the statement, “Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future.” Even though this article was published before the rise of AI, this idea feels even more relevant now. The presence of large corporations shapes viewer experience, which is why independent work feels significant. While I agree that “Individuals can steer the web back to its original architecture simply by having a website,” I question how possible this is because smaller websites are harder to gain traction. Personally, I enjoy when artists have custom websites, especially as reflections of personality. I’m especially drawn to the idea that the beauty of websites lies in their unfinished nature. This makes me wonder if websites ever die. Additionally, the metaphor of websites as plants resonates with me because it emphasizes growth rather than perfection. Overall, this article reframed how I think about websites not as final products, but as an evolving world.
