    Why Restaurant Websites Are Good and We’re All Going to Miss Them made me reflect on the role of restaurant websites in shaping expectations. The Dimes website feels intentionally nostalgic, carefully designed, and references an older version of the web. Here, nostalgia becomes a design choice that adds personality. Before this reading, I wouldn’t have thought to visit the websites of my local restaurants. I typically only check a restaurant’s website if it’s mainstream. Now, I am curious about what my hometown restaurant websites might reveal. These websites act as extensions of the physical space, communicating atmosphere in ways Instagram and Google may not. The reading highlights how much room there is for growth in web tools that allow personality to come through online. A restaurant website is not just informational, it can influence a decision to visit. AI has the potential to make design more accessible for restaurants. This points to the importance of understanding how AI and digital tools function, so they can support website design.
