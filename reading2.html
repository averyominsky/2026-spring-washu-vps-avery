The New Turning Test depicts how AI generated content feels generic and inhuman, ultimately deceiving the viewer. I have definitely experienced seeing images that look “real”, but upon closer inspection are AI. On the other end, I have experienced generating an AI image where it does not look believable and appears AI made. This idea connects to design, AI generated or not, content can feel generic and easily forgotten. The idea that “What matters is that the work is expressive,” resonates with me because it demonstrates that intention and point of view are essential in art. AI is pushing artists to be specific and personal, which is an exciting thought.
